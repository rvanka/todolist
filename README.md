# Todolist with time tracking per task
This is a fork of the Todolist app by Grant Ammons, hosted at todolist.site. 

This app adds time tracking functionality to version 0.6 of the todolist app. The web app functionality appears
to be broken by this change. 

## How does it work?
Add the time allocated to a task when the task is created. Also works with the edit interface.

todolist a +p1 finish qualification of project. hrs8 due fri

todolist l

 all
  1 [ ] Fri Sep 8   8h  0%  +p1 finish qualification of project.


Update the time spent using the following command

todolist u 1 %4

todolist l

 all
  1 [ ] Fri Sep 8   8h  50% +p1 finish qualification of project.


This shows up in the list as the % of the number of hours allocated.


Feedback and suggestions appreciated.
